//type hinting, docstrings and linting//

#type hints (with mypy)
-Decided to add type hinting for this project, but only after writing pretty much all of the important code.
-Returning to work with a larger project becomes much easier when you don't need to spend extra time on figuring out 
 types
 --together with docstrings, makes navigating, rewriting and adding code so much easier.

**Important things regarding type hints**
1. some rows have 'type: ignore' command to stop mypy or ruff (see #linting below) errors 


 2. some files have imports needed for type hints to work properly
    from __future__ import annotations --> to prevent type errors during function evaluation time; allows the program 
    to run without throwing NameErrors on undefined names
    from typing import TYPE_CHECKING --> for adding class imports for types and types only; these are only imported 
    during testing, not when actually running the program

==>To run, just type:
	 mypy 'your_file_path' --strict
   Here the --strict ensures stricter type enforcement which might at times be annoyingly meticulous.


#docstrings
-Had some poor documentating before, mostly using just comments. But as some modules/functions have much more 
 complexity, decided that it would be a good thing to add better documentations for future reference.
-Current docstrings follow mostly Google style guide -> https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings


#linting
-installed 'ruff' extension which is very good at detecting poor coding practises with indentation, naming and 
 duplicate lines.

==>You can run ruff in VS Code terminal, or just use cmd/powershell. You need to type:
	ruff check 'your_file_path'

----Other----
#doctests
-These were added to have better documentations with examples included under bot/api.
-The idea with these is to check whether all basic commands work
-You can run doctests on command line, but the easier way is to just run commands_doctests.py script, found in _ocr_tests
**doctests might be a bit dated at this point, because README.md serves as main documentation**
