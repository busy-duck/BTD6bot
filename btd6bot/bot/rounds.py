        CURRENT_ROUND (tuple[float, float, float, float], class attribute): Text location of current in-game round, 
            located in the upper-right of screen.
        UPGRADE_TEXT (tuple[float, float, float, float], class attribute): Used in starting the first round.
        NEXT_TEXT (tuple[float, float, float, float], class attribute): Exiting map.
        LEVEL_UP (tuple[float, float, float, float], class attribute): Level up text location --CURRENTLY UNUSED--
        DEFEAT (tuple[float, float, float, float], class attribute): Defeat screen 'bloons leaked' text location.
        BUTTONS (dict[str, tuple[float, float]], class attribute): All required button locations to operate in-game

        DEFEAT_CHECK_FREQUENCY (int, class attribute): Controls the frequency of defeat checks under Rounds.Â¨
            round_check, Monkey._check_upgrade, and Monkey._place. Increasing the value makes defeat screen detection 
            slower, but improves speed (and thus accuracy) of ocr in listed methods.

        begin (int, class attribute): Current plan first round. Should only change its value through a plan file when 
            initialize() is called.
        end (int, class attribute): Current plan last round. Should only change its value through a plan file when 
            initialize() is called.
        current_round_begin_time (float, class attribute): Stores starting time of current round. Should only change 
            its value after round_check verifies current round.
        defeat_status (bool, class attribute): Whether bot has been unable to place/upgrade a tower for a set period of 
            time: this time is determined under BotVars.checking_time_limit.
        escsettings_checked (bool, class attribute): Whether automatic game settings check has been performed once.
